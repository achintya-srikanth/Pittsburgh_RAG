1. **Failure to File**: If an employer fails to file payroll taxes on time, there might be a failure-to-file penalty which is usually a percentage of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

2. **Failure to Pay**: If an employer fails to pay the taxes due, they might face a failure-to-pay penalty, which is also typically a percentage of the unpaid taxes per month.

3. **Inaccurate Reporting**: Providing incorrect information or underreporting the amount of payroll taxes can result in additional fines and penalties.

4. **Fraud**: If the failure to comply is deemed to be fraudulent, the penalties can be significantly more severe, including higher fines and possible criminal charges.

The exact percentages, amounts, and further consequences depend on specific regulations and the jurisdiction in question. It is essential to consult with a tax professional or legal advisor to understand the precise implications for a specific case. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has guidelines and resources available that detail the penalties associated with various types of payroll tax violations in the United States.
