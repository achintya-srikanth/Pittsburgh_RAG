Have you ever wanted to go somewhere to quietly read but also crave being around other people while you do it?

Bring your own book, whether it's a physical copy, an audiobook, or Kindle and partake in 30 minutes of conversation followed by an hour of silent reading.

Kara Walker: Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated)
🖼️
Mar. 1 - May 25 | Frick Pittsburgh
Comprised of 15 large scale prints, Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) revisits the historical representations found in the two-volume anthology published in 1866, "Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War." Walker overlays enlargements of woodcut plates with her black silkscreen cutout figures in solid black silhouette. In doing so, Walker brings to light experiences of racism that were often omitted or merely hinted at in traditional historical narratives.

Mar. 1 - Aug. 17 | Carnegie Science Center
Break the stigma. Build understanding. Start the conversation. Step into an immersive journey designed to break stigma, build understanding, and spark important conversations. The “Mental Health: Mind Matters” traveling exhibition brings the science of mental health to life through immersive exhibits and personal stories, offering a deeper look into the complexities of mental well-being.
